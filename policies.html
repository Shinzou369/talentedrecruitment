                <h2>Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement</h2>
                <p><em>Issued under Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015</em></p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This statement outlines the steps Talented Recruitment has taken, and continues to take, to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking do not occur within our business operations or supply chains.</p>
                <p>Talented Recruitment operates a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of modern slavery and exploitation. We are committed to acting ethically, transparently, and with integrity in all our business relationships, and to maintaining effective systems and controls designed to prevent exploitation at any level of our organisation.</p>

                <h3>Our Business</h3>
                <p>Talented Recruitment is a UK-based recruitment and talent consultancy, supporting clients across a range of sectors. Our business is built on responsible recruitment practices, strong ethical standards, and long-term partnerships with both clients and candidates.</p>

                <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                <p>We do not tolerate or condone forced, bonded, or involuntary labour in any form. We strictly prohibit child labour, servitude, and human trafficking within our operations and expect the same high standards from all organisations we work with.</p>
                <p>We are committed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working only with clients, suppliers, and partners who uphold high ethical and labour standards</li>
                    <li>Ensuring all recruitment practices are fair, transparent, and voluntary</li>
                    <li>Maintaining awareness of modern slavery risks within our industry</li>
                    <li>Taking immediate and appropriate action where any breach or suspected breach is identified</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Policies and Controls</h3>
                <p>To support our commitment, Talented Recruitment maintains a number of internal policies and procedures, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy, setting out clear expectations for staff and suppliers</li>
                    <li>Ethical Conduct and Corporate Social Responsibility policies, reinforcing integrity and accountability</li>
                    <li>Recruitment and Employment policies, requiring lawful, fair, and voluntary working practices</li>
                    <li>Whistleblowing and Grievance procedures, providing safe and confidential routes for raising concerns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risk Assessment and Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>Although the nature of our business presents a low risk of modern slavery, we recognise that recruitment activities and supply chains can carry inherent risks. To mitigate these risks, we:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review supplier and partner relationships to ensure fair labour practices</li>
                    <li>Carry out appropriate background checks on new suppliers and service providers</li>
                    <li>Include ethical and compliance requirements within supplier terms where appropriate</li>
                    <li>Monitor for irregularities in pay, working hours, or working conditions that may indicate exploitation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Training and Awareness</h3>
                <p>Team members involved in recruitment or supplier engagement receive additional guidance on due diligence and reporting responsibilities. Awareness is reinforced through onboarding, internal communications, and regular policy reviews.</p>

                <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
                <p>Talented Recruitment is committed to continuous improvement in addressing modern slavery risks. We will continue to strengthen our approach through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular reviews of policies and procedures</li>
                    <li>Ongoing staff training and awareness initiatives</li>
                    <li>Enhanced supplier vetting and documentation</li>
                    <li>Improved reporting, monitoring, and oversight processes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We recognise that addressing modern slavery requires ongoing vigilance, not just regulatory compliance.</p>

                <h3>Approval</h3>
                <p>This statement has been approved by the Managing Director of Talented Recruitment and will be reviewed annually. The most recent version will always be available on our website.</p>
