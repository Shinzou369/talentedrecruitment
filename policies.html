                <h2>Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement</h2>
                <p><em>Issued under Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015</em></p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This statement sets out the steps that Talented Recruitment has taken, and will continue to take, to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within our business or supply chains.</p>
                <p>Talented Recruitment has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically, transparently, and with integrity in all our business dealings, and to implementing effective systems and controls to prevent exploitation of people in any part of our operations.</p>

                <h3>Our Business and Structure</h3>
                <p>Talented Recruitment is a UK-based recruitment and talent consultancy supporting clients across multiple sectors.</p>

                <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                <p>We will not tolerate, permit, or condone the use of forced, bonded, or involuntary labour in any form. We also prohibit child labour, servitude, and human trafficking in our operations and expect the same standards from every organisation we work with.</p>
                <p>We are committed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting business only with suppliers and partners who uphold high ethical and labour standards</li>
                    <li>Ensuring all recruitment practices are fair, transparent, and voluntary</li>
                    <li>Maintaining awareness of modern slavery risks within our industry</li>
                    <li>Taking prompt action if we identify or suspect any breach of these principles</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Policies and Controls</h3>
                <p>To reinforce our commitment, we have established a set of internal policies and procedures, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy (sets clear reporting expectations and supplier standards)</li>
                    <li>Ethical Policy and Corporate Social Responsibility Policy (ensure integrity in decision-making)</li>
                    <li>Recruitment and Employment Policies (require fair, voluntary, and lawful employment practices)</li>
                    <li>Whistleblowing and Grievance Policy (provides safe routes for raising concerns without fear of reprisal)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risk Assessment and Due Diligence</h3>
                <p>While our operations are low-risk by nature, we recognise that recruitment and supply chain activities can present vulnerabilities to modern slavery. To mitigate these:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We review supplier relationships to ensure fair labour standards</li>
                    <li>We conduct background checks on new partners and service providers</li>
                    <li>We include ethical-compliance clauses in supplier terms where applicable</li>
                    <li>We monitor for irregularities in pay, working hours, or conditions that may signal exploitation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Training and Awareness</h3>
                <p>All staff receive information about identifying and reporting potential modern slavery risks. Managers involved in recruitment or supplier engagement receive specific guidance on due diligence and reporting responsibilities. We continue to promote awareness through internal communications and updates during onboarding and policy reviews.</p>

                <h3>Future Actions and Continuous Improvement</h3>
                <p>We will continue to strengthen our approach through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular policy and supplier reviews</li>
                    <li>Ongoing staff training and awareness</li>
                    <li>Improved supplier vetting and documentation</li>
                    <li>Enhanced reporting processes and data monitoring</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We understand that tackling modern slavery requires ongoing vigilance and continuous improvement - not just compliance.</p>

                <h3>Approval</h3>
                <p>This statement has been approved by the Managing Director of Talented Recruitment and will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.</p>
